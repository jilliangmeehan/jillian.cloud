[Give with us](https://www.givewith.us/) is a platform for shoppers to connect with people who are donating their sales + commission to organizations they care about.

[Laustrology](https://laustrology.com/) is a no-bullshit astrology website that I built for my friend (and astrologist) Laura Tormos.

[should i do this project?](https://shouldidoit.glitch.me/) is a handy exercise for figuring out whether or not you should take on a new side project.

I also built [Cassie Burge's portfolio](https://cassieburge.glitch.me/).
