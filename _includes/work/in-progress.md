I’m building [SNAX](http://snaxreport.com/), a zine about all things snacks. While SNAX is still in-progress, check out [SNAX: Bite-Sized](https://gumroad.com/l/snax-bite-sized), a mini teaser of what’s to come. If you’d like to contribute to the zine (or join our Slack), get in touch at [snaxreport.com](http://snaxreport.com/).
