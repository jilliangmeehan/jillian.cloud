I’m an Operations Associate at [Lickability](https://lickability.com/), a small software studio based in New York.

We’ve worked on apps for clients including The Atlantic, Aloe Bud, Houseparty, and The New Yorker. We also have a few apps of our own—check out [Pinpoint](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pinpoint-screenshot-editor/id669858907?mt=8) and [Accelerator](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/accelerator-speed-reader/id675410630?mt=8) on the App Store!

I run the Lickability [blog](https://blog.lickability.com/) and [social media](https://twitter.com/lickability) accounts, and I’m learning to code apps in Swift.
